# An Informatics System for Breath-by-Breath Analysis of Sleep Data 

## Overview
This repository was established to share the source code and latest updates for the informatics system developed by Yike Li and colleagues at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. The system is designed to facilitate breath-by-breath analysis of sleep data, as detailed in the following publication:

## Deployment
We are in the process of deploying this system as a web-based application with a graphical user interface (GUI) to enhance accessibility for the sleep research community. The application can be accessed at https://prod.tbilab.org/KentSleepApp. Please note that the application is temporarily offline for maintenance and software upgrades. Stay tuned for our updates.
